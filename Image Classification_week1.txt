Image Classification

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier using MobileNetV2 and Keras. It allows classification of both local and online images, batch image evaluation, and result visualization. The model leverages ImageNet knowledge to identify a wide range of object categories.

This Python-based project builds a powerful, modular, and extensible image classification system using TensorFlowâ€™s MobileNetV2, a pre-trained deep learning model optimized for speed and accuracy.

Key Features:
 Pre-trained MobileNetV2 model (1000+ ImageNet classes)
 Support for local files and online images
 Top-k predictions with confidence levels
 Visualization grid for results
 Category grouping (animals, vehicles, fruits, etc.)
 Tools for custom dataset evaluation (accuracy + confusion matrix)
 Batch classification and reusability with class-based design
